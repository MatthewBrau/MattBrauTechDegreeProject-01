        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am a political public affairs professional providing campaigns with voter contact support in the field and over the phone.</p>
        <p>Successful organizers go where the people are. As technology advances and we become more connected, I'm seeking to take my career in a different direction. I am motivated to learn new digital skills organizing activists online.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I hope to master the tools used by today's activists to drive progessive change:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>Social Media</li>
          <li>Web Design</li>
          <li>Digital Advertising</li>
          <li>Fundraising Strategy</li>
          <li>Engagement</li>
        </ul>
        <p> In the end I hope to work at a digital consulting firm providing clients with creative ways to engage their audiences and drive them to act.</p>

      <h2> I am not sure where to begin... why not here? </h2>
      <H3>April 25, 2018</h3>
      <P> If you are reading this, thank you for visiting my first crack at designing a webpage. The first few weeks using Treehouses' selfpaced tools were daunting, but the more and more I exercise the skills I learned here, the more patterns I see. Just like learning a language, the real way to learn is immersing yourself in the conversation you are building through your projects and being comfortable with not knowing everything right away </p>
      <p> The biggest challenge I forsee in my journey will be my ability to keep a steady pace of continued study. I am prone to procrastinating and feeling discouraged. I hope to be able to surprise myself in the next few weeks. </P>
      <P> I am looking forward to seeing the results. To celebrate this first page, here's a picture of my dog Carmen!</p>

      <p> cheers!</p>
